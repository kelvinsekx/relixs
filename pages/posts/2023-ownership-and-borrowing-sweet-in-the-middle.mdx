# The Concept of Ownership and Borrowing

<p className="text-center">Sit tight, you're in the middle!!</p>

One of the the benevolence factors that has helped Rust popularity is the novel concept of ownership and borrowing - #it is nothing new on papers.
Rust falls among the leading industrially used language to successfully and wholesomely implement this feature.

There have always been two extremes.

When it concerns memory management, there have been two extremes: Manual Memory Management - MMM - and Garbage Collection - GC - (Pardonably, Automatic Memory Management).

<p className="text-center">Rust sits in between, but completely dishing GC</p>

[Garbage Collection is an automatic effort that replaces manual memory management for devs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29). It sniffs for unused objects in the heap memory and recollects them - free them, at intervals unlike MMM where programmers specify what objects are de-allocated and when.

MMM can be tedious and unforgiving.

In the beginning stages, Rust combined GC and its original Ownership and Borrowing algorithm similar to [Ada](https://ada-lang.io/), [Modula-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-3) etc

Today, Rust do not run on GC any longer, but its ownership and borrowing algorithm alone. **However, with the super power to opt-in to de-allocating memory whenever you want to - with the drop function. 99% of time when you do this, you shouldn't**.
