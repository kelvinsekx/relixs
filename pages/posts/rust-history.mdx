# The History of Rust

Rust is a programming language as in the case of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP et cetera ([HTML and CSS are controversial especially with argument for and against](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/tio5jn/is_html_a_programming_language_your_opinion/i1fw77i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)).

[Unlike languages like JavaScript that happened in the span of a week](https://www.quora.com/Javascript-was-created-in-10-days-How-can-one-of-the-largest-and-most-popular-languages-used-today-be-created-in-just-10-days), Rust had an enormous long period of development before it was used or accessible to the public. It was a research work that has turned out to be worth it ðŸ§€.

## Why you should care about Rust's history?

History empowers us to appreciate the past, present and give a hint on how the future may turn out to become.
From the day I began inquiring into the past of Rust, I was empowered with clarity of whys, appreciate it syntaxes and philosophies, and why the language matters. I hope by the end of reading this article you are as illuminated as well as I was.

## The Past happened in Eras

According to Steve Klabnik, Rust has had 5 stages. In this article, our discussion will beat around these lines. Below are the stages as listed according to Steve:

- The Personal Years, 2006 - 2009
- The Graydon Years, 2010 - 2013
- The Type System Years, 2012 - 2014
- The Release Year, 2015 - 2016
- Production Years, 2017 - present

## Everything is an iteration

Rust has evolved in terms of its features and syntaxes across each era, but basically the exact same language in terms of its goals and missions - Compilation, Speed, System and Safety.

The process that gave birth to Rust features and syntaxes has been characterized by identification of a fit feature, implementing them and an awaiting period of experimentation to see if the feature should remain. This affirms the conclusion that Rust came out from Research and Development experimentation in Mozilla.

## The Personal Years (2006 - 2009) - Crude Development Times

It was meant to be a compiled, concurrent, safe, systems programming language. This era is defined as Personal because Greydon Hoare - original creator of Rust - was developing this in his spare time. He got the motivation to writing this new programming language because of his experience with Elevation Crash in the building he lived.

## The Graydon Years (2010 - 2013) - Author's Recognition and Project Momentum Times

In 2009, Mozilla started sponsoring Rust, with Graydon becoming a BDFL - Benevolent for Dictator for Life - style figure. And then the team slowly grew.

## The Type system Years (2012 - 2014) - Author's Step Asides Times

Employment of people with PhDs to improve Rust type safe system. As the type system grew, more and more part of the language moved to the libraries.

And Graydon steps-down from the project.

## The Release Year, 2015 - 2016

This was the year 1.0 of Rust was available for heavy public use with an assurance of no sudden change to the language that won't be backward compatible. This promise has had the good and bad sides of it. For example, the double pattern of Generics among many.

The use of where for Generics happened after the release year. Originally, Rust approach to things would have been to keep on and let go of the other one that was less better. But because of the promise of forever compatibility from 2016, we kinda lost the magic of not keeping things we no longer find useful.

## The Production Year, 2016+

These are the years where Rust began being used on production apps outside Mozilla

## Early Assumptions

- Keywords can't be longer than 5 characters.

  For example, in the early days the keyword "return" was written as in "ret"

  ```Rust
  fn max(int x, int y)-> int {
      if (x > y) {
          ret x;
      } else {
          ret y;
      }
  }
  ```

- types were before variable like C and C#

  ```Rust
      int x = 5;
      string name = "Kelvinsekx"
  ```

- Explicit Object orientation with the obj keyword

  ```rust
      obj counter(int i) {
          fn incr() {
              i += 1;
          }

          fn get()-> int {
              ret i
          }
      }
  ```

- auto keyword for explicit type inference

  ```rust
      auto name = "Kelvinsekx"
  ```

- Type generics with square brackets, []

  ```rs
  fn main() {
      log "hello, world!"
  }

  fn max(int x, int y)-> int {
      if (x > y) {
          ret x;
      } else {
          ret y;
      }
  }

  obj counter(int i) {
      fn incr() {
          i += 1;
      }

      fn get()-> int {
          ret i
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      auto c = counter(10);
      c.incr();
      log c.get()
  }

  obj swap[T](tup(T, T), pair)-> tup(T, T) {
      ret tup(pair._1, pair._0);
  }

  fn main(){
      auto str_pair = tup("hi", "there");
      auto int_pair = tup(10, 12);

      str_pair = swap[str](str_pair);
      int_pair = swap[int](int_pair);
  }
  ```

Popular ideology

- Memory Safety, no wild pointers
- Typestate system, no null pointers
- Mutability control, immutable by default
- Side-effect control, pure by default
  - You can break the rules
  - You have to authorize where and how
- Used Garbage collector

In 2009, Mozilla decided to officially sponsor Rust

## Rust is not all Sugar

Rust is not a perfect language. In fact, Graydon wrote:

<BlockQuote
  content={`More specifically...Rust lacks: 
 the clang importer, reflection, a repl and playgrounds, runtime-dynamic generics, keyword arguments, cleanly-integrated reference-typed classes, user-extensible pattern matching, simplified local borrow-like alias control, compiler-supported ARC, generally much lower cognitive load).`}
  author={`Graydon, 2018`}
></BlockQuote>

To be fair, Rust has since implemented most of these lacking features. For example, if you are not popular with any aforementioned, a repl and playground should make a reminder. Although it has implemented many of the features it is lacking in 2018, it is yet not close to perfect.

## Obvious Change: Then and Now

```rust
rec(task task, chan[T] chan)

// where task and chan are keywords that the language knows about
```

Similar thing would have been written as below in today's Rust

```Rust
use std::thread:task;
use std::sync::mps:chan;

struct Foo<T> {
    thread: task,
    chan: chan
}
```

Another thing Rust was famous for in this era was pointers.

```Rust
let x = @5 // Garbage collector pointer
let y = ~5 // Unique pointer
let z = &5 // borrowed pointer
```

These would have been written as

```Rust
let y = Box::new(5); // box
let z = &5; // reference
```

The type system year also had additions that were not particularly type specific like Cargo and Crates.io
