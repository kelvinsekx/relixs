2023 started out very hopeful. It's 1st January, I just rejected an offer of $1,200 per month from a company because I wasn't excited about their infrastructures. I was about to blow ðŸ”¥ - No words could describe how I feel as I anticipate earning $3000+ from a company I was crazy excited for Commercetools, Germany among so many.

But very quickly, the year turned into one of the bloodiest years. On the first Friday of the same year, I got a rejection letter from Commercetools citing hiring freeze as a reason. But it wasn't only Commercetools, the tech industry has just been hit by a major shake off and retrenchment. Gods be so good, I just got my own share.

It wasn't only my rejection, the country I reside in, Nigeria, was having another one of its heated period in a span of years, It's the National Election. It brought with it too much drama including money scarcity, fuel hike and protests.

Terrible things upon terrible things began to set into the new year that had almost not began. Well, I didn't make you come here to read tales of how terrible life was in 2023, because it wasn't all evil to be sincere.

Hopefully by the time you are done reading, you would have learned one or two to make 2024 better for all of us.

## Don't have a Leading Goal

Into the new year, my leading goal was to get a full-time job into a company that had some pattern that must meet criteria like

1. Providing me a work Laptop
2. Health Insurance
3. Solid engineering team and path where I can get mentored and provide mentorship too
4. Sizeably funded and that I have an idea how much they've raised or earned

Is this too much to ask for ðŸ˜­?

I structured the rest of my goals in such a way that if I didn't get a full time job, they were going to have to wait.

Well, every other goals were sitting waiting for me to achieve that one first. But this little goal became one of the difficult thing to achieve in all of 2023. There were over 500k tech professionals laid off with an unending hiring freeze. The best of companies weren't employing new hires especially not intermediate talents like myself.

Come 2024, my goals will be [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) and independent of one another.

Let me give you a taste of how it will look like

The overall aim is nothing, absolutely nothing, is catching me by surprise. I'm not relying God's miracle for the most favorable conditions; I'm simply just making possible chances. Although they are possible chances, the sets of conditional goals must be less than 4.

This leading goal problem didn't just end with me. I also took it into the club. If you didn't know, I'm the founder and community lead of Ibadan Techies.

The roadmap for 2023 for the club was planned based on one of our Backers promises ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜† I laugh in shege. Everything went just like what happended in my Personal life. Tech happended and we were grounded. I didn't think of alternatives.

## Financially Discipline

One of the things that happened on the side was that I developed an appetite for financial discipline.

I and a friend gave ourselves a track to save a particular amount on each end before December ended, failure to do this will donate a sum of 20,000 naira to charity.

I took it very seriously despite the troubled year. I am glad to have achieved something no minding the terrible year. This reality has helped me maintain buckets of finances this year.

However, now I realized I've kept three accounts/finances

1. Savings in cowrywise
   Here I put 20% of whatever I earn and it is not withdrawable. Cowrywise won't even let me.

2. Business finances
   This is the total money I've invested into businesses or investments with goal of earning a return

3. Current/Expenditure finances
   This account remained negative throughout the year. It covers for debts, everyday expenses, lending etc. It took a 50%+ share of my finances and yet I had to keep borrowing to keep up.

From next year, I'm adding two more finance buckets

4. Contingent finances
   This is a 30 days interval non withdrawable amount. The goal is to use it to quench extreme brokeness (Brokeness wan kill me this year).

5. Group contingent savings
   A pooled amount between myself and some friends that serves as the pocket to cover quick and intentional expenses.

   I already joined a thrift thanks to Kiishi. The goal is to use this finances for shopping and **buy things strictly for myself**. A once a year shopping isn't bad!

These are the major things I learned in the year. I can't wait to improve on them in the coming years.

If you enjoyed this one, you can't wait to read my goals and strategy for 2024 coming up January 4, 2024.
